# Open data
## LoRa link quality

A (LoRa) network link quality can be assessed through two main metrics:  the SNR and the RSSI. The two datasets contain SNR and RSSI measurements collected in various distances in different environments. The [first dataset](csv/snr_rssi_gps_data.csv)

## Data coverage
Date from: 20-08-20\
Date to: 20-08-26

## Parameters
Below are the supported parameters :
- SNR Signal-to-Noise Ratio
- RSSI Reaceived Signal Strength Indicator (dBm)
- Distance (m)
- LAT Latitude
- LGT Longitude



These data has been published under the Open data initiative from the Smart Village Living Lab, in the context of the Wazihub project (www.wazihub.com), partenered with Sonatel, Orange, and University Gaston Berger of Saint-Louis.
